# Distributions (Simple Explanation)

In statistics, distribution describes how data is spread out or arranged. Different types of distributions tell us about the shape and spread of the data. Here are some common types of distributions:

### 1. Normal Distribution (Bell Curve)
  - What it is: A symmetrical distribution where most data points are concentrated around the mean, and the frequency of values decreases as you move away from the mean.
  - Shape: Looks like a bell.
  - Examples: Heights, IQ scores, and many natural phenomena are normally distributed.


Simple Example: Most people are of average height, with fewer very short or very tall people.


### 2. Skewed Distribution
  - What it is: A distribution where data is not evenly spread and has a long tail on one side.
  - Two Types:
    - Right-skewed (Positive Skew): The tail is on the right, meaning more values are on the left.
      - Example: Income distribution, where a few people have very high incomes.
    - Left-skewed (Negative Skew): The tail is on the left, meaning more values are on the right.
      - Example: Age at retirement, where most people retire at a typical age but a few retire very young.
